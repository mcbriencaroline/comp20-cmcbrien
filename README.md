My Learning Portfolio

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
To store our work in a way that allows us to show it off/access it easily even after the class is over!

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
Assignment 3 was actually my favorite assignment. By that point I had a pretty good idea how html and javascript worked, but it was really interesting to tie that into the server side of the application. I really enjoyed implementing the server side, because it gave me insight into so many things on the web actually work--like how information is actually stored and accessed. Seeing that, and seeing how it all fit together in the NotUber web app, was really cool.

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
I have grown a lot over the course of this semester in this class. I came in knowing basically nothing about web programming, and now I feel I have a pretty good grasp on the basics. I also leanred a lot about how to teach myself information, and I leanred that it's actually pretty easy to teach myself a new programming skill. I definitely leanred the value of google, but I also learned that the best way to learn some of this stuff is simply to test it out myself.

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
//teaching self


5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I think I would like to delver deeper into front-end development type stuff. Especially after working on the game for our semester group project, I have realized just how much there is to play with out there--so many different frameworks to work with, which are all helpful in different ways.
