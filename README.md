My Learning Portfolio

1) What is this purpose of this Git repository? 

To store our work in a way that allows us to show it off/access it easily even after the class is over!

2) What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

Assignment 3 was actually my favorite assignment. By that point I had a pretty good idea how html and javascript worked, but it was really interesting to tie that into the server side of the application. I really enjoyed implementing the server side, because it gave me insight into so many things on the web actually work--like how information is actually stored and accessed. Seeing that, and seeing how it all fit together in the NotUber web app, was really cool.

3) How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I feel I have grown a lot over the course of the semester in this class. I came in knowing basically nothing about web programming, and now I feel I have a pretty good grasp on the basics. Not only has my knowledge as a programmer grown, but I have also become better at learning things on my own, and at collaborating with multiple people in a group to create a product.

4) What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned was how to learn on my own, and I leanred that it's actually pretty easy to teach myself new programming skills on my own. I definitely leanred the value of google, but I also learned that the best way to learn some of this stuff is simply to test it out myself. I specifically remember Assignment 1, where we had to create a personal website, being the first time I leanred this lesson. We had gone over the basics of html in class, but I had no idea how I was supposed to create a whole website for myself--I felt like there was still so much I didn't know how to do. Practically everytime I wanted to do something new I had to look it up first. But afterwards, I felt proud that I had figured out how to do so much on my own, and had created something I was proud of. Another time I learned the importance of learning on my own was when I first started Assignment 2, the client side of the Black Car Service. I wanted to dive into the project, but there was so much of it that I was unclear on/confused me. It took a lot of googling about geolocation and the Google API before I could begin in earnest. These two instances in particular, taught me the value of being able to get answers for myself, and being more self-relient when it came to discovering new things in web programming.


5) Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I think I would like to delver deeper into front-end development type stuff. Especially after working on the game for our semester group project, I have realized just how much there is to play with out there--so many different frameworks to work with, which are all helpful in different ways.
